Creating a CUDA program to recover an elliptic curve key using side-channel techniques is a highly specialized task that involves both cryptography and parallel computing. While side-channel attacks, such as those based on timing or power analysis, can be very effective in practice, implementing them is complex and requires a deep understanding of both the specific elliptic curve being attacked and the details of the side-channel information.

Here's a basic outline of how one might approach writing a CUDA program for this task. This is a highly simplified example and is meant to illustrate the general approach rather than a full, working implementation. A real-world implementation would need to handle many more details and security considerations.

### Requirements

1. **CUDA Toolkit**: Make sure you have the CUDA toolkit installed and set up.
2. **Elliptic Curve Library**: You might need an elliptic curve library that supports CUDA. For simplicity, we will not include the full library in this example.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Gather Side-Channel Data**: Collect side-channel information that includes intermediate elliptic curve point coordinates. This is usually done through hardware-based attacks and not part of the CUDA code itself.

2. **Setup CUDA Environment**: Initialize CUDA and allocate memory for data transfer.

3. **Implement Attack Logic**: Use the collected side-channel data to infer the private key. This will involve computations on elliptic curve points and might involve reverse engineering based on the observed data.

### Simplified CUDA Example

Here's a simplified example that demonstrates the structure of such a program. This example does not include a real elliptic curve implementation or side-channel data, but it shows how you might set up and use CUDA to process data in parallel.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// CUDA kernel to process elliptic curve data
__global__ void processEllipticCurveData(float* d_data, float* d_results, int dataSize) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < dataSize) {
        // Example computation: just copy data for illustration
        d_results[idx] = d_data[idx] * 2.0f; // Dummy operation, replace with actual elliptic curve logic
    }
}

int main() {
    const int dataSize = 1000; // Size of the side-channel data
    float h_data[dataSize];    // Host data
    float h_results[dataSize]; // Host results

    // Initialize data with example values
    for (int i = 0; i < dataSize; ++i) {
        h_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }

    float *d_data, *d_results;

    // Allocate memory on the GPU
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, dataSize * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc(&d_results, dataSize * sizeof(float));

    // Copy data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, dataSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (dataSize + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    processEllipticCurveData<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, d_results, dataSize);

    // Copy results from device to host
    cudaMemcpy(h_results, d_results, dataSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Print some results (for debugging purposes)
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << h_results[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Free GPU memory
    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFree(d_results);

    return 0;
}
```

### Important Notes:

1. **Complexity**: Real implementations involve more complex logic, especially when dealing with elliptic curve mathematics. You would need to use libraries that provide elliptic curve operations and handle the mathematical intricacies.

2. **Performance Optimization**: For practical use, you would need to optimize both the CUDA code and the elliptic curve operations to handle large datasets efficiently.

In practice, recovering a private key from side-channel data involves complex statistical analysis and cryptographic techniques that go beyond a simple CUDA example. For a real-world application, you'd need to integrate sophisticated algorithms for elliptic curve operations and side-channel data analysis.
